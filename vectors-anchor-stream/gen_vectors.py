Every member is built from the stream bundled with the pinned tag
`anchors-verify-v0.4` of `aos-standard/catalog`, which is vendored in
`baseline/`. A member is one triple: the presented stream, the digest sidecar
presented with it, and the platform bytes a verifier would read while checking
it. The third file is what makes a run offline and repeatable: the verifier
reads the witness platform over the network, and a corpus whose verdict depends
on a live fetch is a corpus whose verdict expires.

Identifiers are a digest of the member's own three files. There is no
`accept/` directory, no `reject/` directory and no verdict in a name: the
expectation lives in MANIFEST.json, which is where a scoring harness reads it.

Every member of this suite in one table, accepted and rejected alike.
Ground truth: `{SPEC_VENDORED}`, the contract text bundled with the pinned tag
`{TARGET_TAG}` of `{TARGET_REPO}` at `{TARGET_COMMIT[:7]}`, whose sha256
`MANIFEST.json` pins as `specDigest`.

This corpus is {total} vectors, of which {accept} a conformant verifier must
not fail closed on and {reject} it must reject.

**What this corpus certifies against, which is not the vendored text alone.**
Two conditions are required by the contract as vendored, and their reject
members are rejectable under it as written. The other eight are corrections
this corpus proposes: the vendored text leaves those cases open, which is why
the correction is worth writing down at all. A row's `basis` column says which
it is, `MANIFEST.json` carries the same field per member, and any table or
count quoted out of this directory carries this sentence with it. Reading a
`proposed` row as a conformance failure against the published text overstates
what the published text requires. Where upstream has since made the same change
the condition names the tag it landed at, which is a fact about their history
rather than a licence to restate the row as vendored.

**What a row states.** An `accept` row states that a conformant verifier does
not fail closed on those bytes, and names the outcome the contract's own table
assigns them. A `reject` row states that a conformant verifier fails closed,
and names the reason it stops. The reason is the load-bearing half. A verifier
that reaches the right verdict from a guard that fired before it evaluated the
property has not evaluated the property, and the verdict column cannot tell
you which happened.

**The platform bytes are pinned.** A verifier for this format reads the witness
platform over the network. Every member therefore carries `witness/<id>.json`,
which holds the bytes the platform serves for each commit the member names,
the bytes of the default branch, and, per commit, whether it is reachable from
that branch. Reachability is a fact about the platform rather than about the
bytes, so it is carried rather than derived. `run_verifier.py` refuses to run
a verifier that reaches for a socket.

**Identifiers name the bytes.** Each identifier is a digest of the member's own
three files. There is no directory per verdict and no prefix per verdict; the
expectation lives in `MANIFEST.json`. A verifier could otherwise certify
against this corpus without opening a stream.

Regenerate byte-identically: `python3 gen_vectors.py`.
Self-check: `aee-verify vectors-anchor-stream/` from the repository root.
Run a verifier: `python3 run_verifier.py --verifier <path-to-anchors_verify.py>`.
