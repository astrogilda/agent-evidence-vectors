# aee-conformance — roadmap

Open work for the conformance-vector suite and reference verifier of the in-toto
Adversarial Execution Evidence (AEE) predicate. Contributions welcome.

> **Session code-health audit 2026-07-24:** `go build ./...` + `go vet ./...` + `mypy` all
> **CLEAN** — no findings for this repo. Combined cross-repo report:
> an internal audit report.

## Status: v0.6 review (in-toto/attestation#570)

The reviewer's independent from-spec checker went 138/138 on the earlier corner-case
features and conceded every open corner; the latest reply invites him to move the v0.6
proposal out of draft.

- [ ] **Await reviewer's read on moving v0.6 out of draft** — no code change pending on
  our side; the next step is the reviewer's call.
- [ ] **v0.7 forward-design — HELD** until v0.6 merges. Do not start new predicate design
  while v0.6 is at the merge line.

## Standards-ecosystem interoperability

- [ ] **SARIF v2.1.0 output** — an `aee-in-sarif` convention doc + emitter so a verifier
  run lands as findings in the GitHub Security tab and any SARIF-consuming tool. Speaks a
  format security teams already ingest.
- [ ] **Framework crosswalk (`.md` + machine-readable `.json`)** — map the AEE evidence
  model and each conformance-vector class to OWASP MCP Top 10, the OWASP Agentic Security
  Initiative Top 10, OWASP AIVSS, and MITRE ATLAS, so findings land in the frameworks
  defenders already report against. Regenerate the table from the vectors; do not hand-edit.
- [ ] **`GOVERNANCE.md`** — document the decision process for new conformance vectors and
  schema changes, deprecation policy (IDs never reused), and the crosswalk-update process.
  Publish the record `$schema` at a stable URL.

## Suite hygiene & citability

- [ ] **Paired positive/negative fixtures per vector** — for each conformance vector, a
  short `<id>_positive` / `<id>_negative` fixture pair so any implementation's detection
  logic can be tested against the standard, with the logic living in the implementer's repo.
- [ ] **Claim -> verdict-token -> reproduce-command manifest** — a table mapping each thing
  the suite asserts to (a) the exact verdict token a verifier emits and (b) a one-line
  command an evaluator runs to reproduce it, so nothing has to be taken on trust.
- [ ] **Shippable tamper-evidence demo** — a dependency-free script that corrupts a copy of
  a signed record two ways (flip one byte, drop one entry) and shows the verifier catches
  each, recomputing from the record's own stored bytes (no re-serialization false alarms).
- [ ] **Citable dataset DOI** — mint a Zenodo (or equivalent) DOI for a tagged release of
  the conformance-vector corpus so it can be cited in papers and reports.

## Supply-chain posture

- [ ] **OpenSSF Scorecard workflow** — add `ossf/scorecard-action` and publish the badge.

## Predicate ergonomics

- [ ] **`honest_limits[]` + `contract_version` fields** — machine-readable declaration of
  exactly what a given evidence record does and does NOT cover, and the predicate contract
  version it was produced under, so a consumer can reason about scope explicitly.
- [ ] **Fail-closed client hygiene** — for any network path a verifier may use, enforce
  immutable config, single-flight, error-on-redirect, and coerce-unknown-toward-reject.

## Known gaps in the gates

- [ ] **A vendored copy that is refreshed, recorded, then reverted stays green.** The
  consumer-lag gate compares `vectors/CONSUMERS.json` against the corpus published here,
  and that ledger records what each copy carried when it was last synced. A copy reverted
  after its sync would keep a stale ledger entry that still matches, and the copy's own
  stamp check cannot see it either, since a revert plus a re-stamp is internally
  consistent. Closing it needs this repository to read the consumer, which is the
  cross-repository read the gate is built to avoid. File: `scripts/consumer-lag-gate.py`.
- [ ] **The sync's re-aim check cannot see a truncated citation.** `--sync` refuses to move
  a citation off text that is still in the document, which catches one whose range
  collapsed onto unrelated prose. A citation cut short of the requirement it exists for,
  where the prose it lost was also edited, reads as an ordinary rewrite and is only
  reported for review. This holds for both spellings, since both now share the rule.
  Fix: compare the citation's own subject rather than its former text.
  File: `scripts/specpins.py`.
- [ ] **Forty-three `spec:NNN` citations address prose they were not written against.**
  The content pin stops citations drifting from here on, but it was added after the
  drift, so it pins what is already there. Measured, not estimated: for every citation
  live at HEAD, take the spec text it addressed in the oldest revision that carries the
  same claim, and ask whether that text is still in the document somewhere the citation
  no longer covers. Forty-three of one hundred citation spans answer yes, which is the
  same moved-off rule `--sync` now enforces, applied backwards over the whole history.
  A close reading of all eighty-seven citations agrees and adds a second class the
  mechanical test cannot see: citations that were aimed at the wrong passage when they
  were written. Two of those are worth separating out, because the rule they cite is not
  in the specification at any line: `NetworkPosture` and `EgressPostures` in
  `aee/types.go` describe a closed posture registry with an append-only minor-version
  rule, where the vendored text names the postures illustratively ("e.g. `no_network`,
  `allowlist`, `sinkhole`") and states no registry. Fix: correct each citation to the
  lines its own claim names, run
  `scripts/spec-citation-gate.py --sync`, and read every changed excerpt against the
  claim beside it, exactly as the nine mis-aimed anchors were corrected. Files: the
  sources under `CITING_GLOBS` in `scripts/spec-citation-gate.py`.

- [ ] **Nothing compares an interpretation entry's anchors with the anchors its own
  prose quotes, outside the registry.** The registry gate now requires an entry's
  `specAnchors` to cover every line reference its title or reading makes, which is what
  found four entries whose recorded anchor sat two lines above the words the entry puts
  in quotation marks. The same disagreement is possible in `vectors/CHANGES.md`,
  `vectors/coverage-unforced.json` and `docs/interpretation-decisions-open.md`, which
  carry anchors and prose side by side with no equivalent check.
  File: `scripts/interpretation-registry-gate.py`.

## Recently landed

- [x] **Force reason-map membership on all three coverage sets** (2026-07-26, `cf0d540`) —
  the spec already made the three coverage sets a disjoint partition of the manifest's
  classes, but only `bad-819` forced the `assessedClasses` side. Added
  `bad-731-outofscope-unknown-class` and `bad-732-routedelsewhere-unknown-class`: each puts
  an unknown class key in one reason map, leaves the result alone, and is rejected as
  coverage-incomplete. Both reference rails (Go `aee/statement.go`, Python
  `_coverage_partition_ok` in `packaging/run_vectors.py`) already enforced it, so the two
  vectors lock the written rule and mutation-prove the rails (reverting the reason-map
  accounting flips both). Corpus now suiteRevision 3, 140 vectors (35 accept + 105 reject);
  full local gate green and remote CI green.
- [x] **Extend registry decision 14** (2026-07-26, `cf0d540`) — recorded the two new
  vectors in `vectors/interpretation-decisions.json`, and added a `CHANGES.md`
  suiteRevision-3 section.
- [x] **Document the registry as a post-run reconciliation surface** (2026-07-26, `cf0d540`) —
  added a note to `docs/interpretation-decisions-open.md` clarifying that the interpretation
  registry is read for post-run reconciliation, not as a pre-implementation answer key.
- [x] **Correct the CI vector-replay label 138 -> 140** (2026-07-26, `cf0d540`).
- [x] **Update the multi-implementation report** (2026-07-26, `cf0d540`) —
  `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-REPORT.md` now records the reviewer's re-run as a third
  fully-independent column on the earlier corner-case features (138/138 spec-diff-led,
  132/138 unchanged).
