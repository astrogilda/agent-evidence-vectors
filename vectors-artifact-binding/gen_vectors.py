"""Generate the artifact-binding conformance corpus.

Eight cases, each a complete trial directory with a binding record beside it,
and each carrying the verdict an implementation of
``spec/artifact-binding/v1.md`` must reach. Regenerate byte-identically with:

    python3 vectors-artifact-binding/gen_vectors.py

Every input is fixed: the signing seed is a published TEST key, the trial bytes
come from ``tools/artifact-binding/fixture.py``, and ``recorded_at`` is a
constant. Nothing here reads the clock, the filesystem outside this directory,
or the network, so two machines produce the same corpus digest.

Why the corpus is three verdicts and not two. A suite of accept and reject
alone cannot catch the defect this contract was written against: a verifier
that answers "pass" or "fail" for a record it could not check to a conclusion.
Three cases below expect ``not-established``, and an implementation that
collapses them into either neighbour scores zero on them rather than passing
by accident.

TEST KEYS ONLY. The seed below is in this file on purpose: a corpus a stranger
cannot regenerate is a corpus they have to trust.
