</p>

A recomputable execution attestation toolkit for the in-toto Adversarial
Execution Evidence predicate, version 0.6.

The predicate's model is execute-and-attest, not match-and-assert: the
consumer recomputes the outcome from carried bytes instead of trusting a
producer-asserted verdict. This repository is a second, independently usable
implementation of that contract: any future producer of the predicateType
can self-certify; any consumer can reject a lying emitter.

Spec line references throughout the code are to the vendored predicate
specification (`spec/predicates/adversarial-execution-evidence.md`). The
upstream commit it was taken from is recorded in
[`spec/VENDOR-PIN.json`](spec/VENDOR-PIN.json), written from git at vendor time
rather than by hand, and `scripts/spec-citation-gate.py` checks that every
line reference still resolves.

## The verification pipeline

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/pipeline.svg" alt="A signed statement passes four byte-pure gates (well-formedness, coverage validity, result recompute, evidence tier) to a verdict; any gate fails closed with no result and no tiers." width="380">
</p>

Four byte-pure gates plus a consumer-relative evidence tier. Any gate fails
closed: no result, no tiers. The full contract, step by step:

1. GATE 0: statement well-formedness. Statement `_type` and
   `predicateType` (fail-closed: exactly one accepted construction, no
   cross-version fallback), result vocabulary, environment members,
   vocabulary shape/subset/digest, corpus manifest digest and duplicate
   attack ids, coverage integrity at attack granularity, per-row
   `actualLayer` altitude, subject cardinality and digest canonicality for
   substrate-carrying statements, `runEntropy` presence, `issuedAt`.
2. GATE 1: coverage validity. Statement-level record checks run first
   (batchRoot presence/recompute over RFC 6962 with domain separation and
   no pad-last-node, duplicate-record rejection, orphaned-root), then per
   `basis: substrate` row: refs resolve and are in range, referenced
   payloads are canonical RFC 8785 + I-JSON `+json` objects carrying the
   reserved members with a run binding equal to the derived one,
   class-match per `aeeKind` with each kind's constraints (arming armedAt
   and posture, sealed still-armed/drop-bound/joint posture equalities,
   examination method), and the row `method` capped by the weakest signed
   `aeeMethod` across covering records. On any failure the attestation is
   invalid and its `result` is never consumed; the report carries no
   result and no tiers.
3. Recompute equality. The carried `result` must equal the pure recompute
   over carried bytes; the recompute reads no records, no signature
   outcomes, no consumer policy.
4. GATE 2: evidence tier. Per row: `declared` (artifact basis), `attested`
   (every covering record verifies against a consumer-pinned substrate
   observation key), else `unattested`. No pinned key means every
   substrate row is `unattested`; the substrate root is never inferred
   from the predicate. A record's `keyid` is a lookup hint, never the
   check, and the tier never alters `result`.

## The failure-code contract

Every rejection carries a stable machine-readable code (`aee/codes.go`).
The deterministic primary code (first in pinned detection order) is the
conformance contract; message text and code order beyond the primary one
are not. A few precedence pins matter to anyone reimplementing the gates.
A missing binding input reports its own member code
(`run-entropy-missing`, `subject-sha256-missing`), not
`run-binding-mismatch`; that code is reserved for values that can be
derived but come out unequal. `records-absent` fires when
`observationRecords` is missing entirely, and `ref-out-of-range` fires
only once records exist. The method cap reads covering records only, so
records that cover nothing do not participate, and the two sealed posture
equalities (pinned digest, arming record's claim) are enforced jointly,
not independently. Signature failure is never a failure code; it is a
tier outcome.

## Conformance vectors

`aee/vectors_test.go` replays the conformance vector suite in this repository
(default `../../vectors`, override `AEE_VECTORS_DIR`): every accept vector
must verify valid with matching result and tier columns under both key
policies; every reject vector must be invalid with the primary code inside
the vector's expected code set, emitting no result and no tiers. The runner
skips with an explicit message when the suite is not yet present. The
pinned-policy key is derived from the published test-key recipe
(`seed(role) = SHA-256("in-toto-aee-test-key/<role>/v1")`). Nothing
private is committed anywhere in this repository.

## The go-witness attestor (`witnessattestor/`)

A go-witness-compatible attestor package; upstream go-witness PR staged.
It follows the upstream sarif pattern: an attestor that runs after the
step's products exist, locates a substrate-emitted evidence statement
among them (`aee-evidence.json` by default), re-hashes it for integrity
against the recorded product digest, and then runs the emit seam (GATE 0
+ GATE 1 + recompute equality), returning an error rather than signing on
any failure. The signed predicate bytes are exactly the validated bytes.

The security scope, stated in the package documentation and binding on every
description of the attestor: the witness envelope key backs the
**producer-asserted plane only** (assembly, gate-validity,
recompute-consistency at pipeline step time), while the
**substrate-covered plane** travels exclusively in the signed
`observationRecords`, verified per record at the consumer's tier
derivation against consumer-pinned substrate observation keys. The
attestor never claims that go-witness observed the execution, and
go-witness's own `commandrun` tracing is never `basis: substrate`. GATE 2
never runs at emit, since the tier is relative to the consumer and
derived by definition; the optional `expect-substrate-key` producer-QA
flag checks record signatures locally and derives no tier.

`cmd/aee-witness-demo` drives the attestor through the real witness run
lifecycle as a library and prints the signed standalone AEE statement.
Consume-side, `cmd/aee-verify` (core module, stdlib-only) is the MVP; a
witness `VerifyRunType` attestor that re-emits gate outcomes as a signed
verification summary is named future work (the witness verify CLI is
currently coupled to its policy attestor).

## On independence

I wrote the Go core here, the sibling Python implementation, and the three
consumer rails in two first-party stacks. Five implementations,
one author, one reading of RFC 8785 and RFC 7493. They catch each other's
transcription errors and the differential fuzzer catches drift between them, but
they cannot catch a misreading of the specification, because they all inherit
the same one. Counting them as independent would be counting the same opinion
five times.

**The number of implementations independent of this specification's author is
one.** [`Rul1an/aee-checker`][aee-checker] is a from-spec Rust implementation
with its own I-JSON parser, RFC 8785 serializer, RFC 6962 Merkle root,
run-binding derivation, and Ed25519 tier, built with no sight of the reference
code. It cleared 125/125 at suiteRevision 1, then re-ran against the round-7
corpus and reached 138/138 at suiteRevision 2 after a spec-diff-led update
(132/138 on the unchanged build), cleared suiteRevision 3 at 140/140, and
cleared suiteRevision 5 at 149/149 after it adopted the normative nesting bound
of 128 and moved its depth counter from per parsed value into the container
branch (aee-checker#3, 2026-07-28). It has not been run against suiteRevision 6,
so this suite publishes no suiteRevision-6 score in its column. In our own voice,
not its author's: two of the four new vectors (`bad-743`, `bad-744`) require
rejecting the Unicode noncharacters RFC 7493 section 2.1 forbids, and its author
has stated the checker does not yet implement that check, so we expect it to
answer valid there where the reference rails answer invalid -- a rule difference
we derived, not a run it produced, and we do not report a derived figure as its
score. The other two new vectors are the depth-boundary pair its container-branch
fix already handles. It keeps its own authorship, history, and CI. The link is
pinned to the build that recorded the 149/149 run.

That one reading has already earned its keep, twice. The specification did not
pin a maximum JSON nesting depth, so all five of my rails chose 128 and agreed at
every depth; the independent checker read the same text and chose 256. For the
127 depths in between, identical bytes were valid evidence to one conformant
verifier and malformed to another. Five agreeing rails could not surface that;
one outside reader surfaced it on contact, and the bound is now normative at 128.
Reading it back a second time surfaced a split the five rails had hidden from
each other: the reference Go rail counted nesting depth per parsed child, so an
empty-container leaf slipped one level past the bound where the Python rail
rejected it -- two first-party rails disagreeing on identical bytes at one exact
depth. That one is fixed and pinned by a boundary vector pair; both findings came
from the same outside reader, and neither could have come from the rails alone.

More outside implementations are wanted, and the count above is the reason.
Wiring one in is roughly a single command against the runner's stdin/stdout
contract, and a conformant checker passes even when it evaluates in a different
order, since the suite compares verdicts and code sets and ignores both message
text and evaluation order.
