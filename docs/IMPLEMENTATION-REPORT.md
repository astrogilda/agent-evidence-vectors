# AEE v0.6 implementation report

A W3C-style "multiple independent interoperable implementations" report for the
Adversarial Execution Evidence predicate (in-toto/attestation PR #570). The
purpose is one claim, made honestly: the specification is determinate enough that
a party who did not write it, working in a different language, reaches the same
verdict on the same bytes.

## How independence is counted here

Independence is a property of authorship, not of implementation count. Six
implementations clear this corpus and one author wrote five of them. Those five
share a single reading of RFC 8785 and RFC 7493, so when they agree they have
confirmed that the reading was transcribed consistently across five languages,
which is worth having and is not the claim this report exists to make. A
misreading of the text produces the same agreement.

**The count of implementations independent of the specification's author is one:**
`Rul1an/aee-checker`. Every determinacy claim below rests on that column and on
nothing else. The first-party rails appear because a conformance suite should
state what it actually runs, not to be counted toward independence.

A measured instance of why the distinction matters: the specification did not pin
a maximum JSON nesting depth, so all five first-party rails chose 128 and agreed
at every depth, while the independent checker read the same text and chose 256.
For the 127 depths between them, identical bytes are valid evidence to one
conformant verifier and malformed to another. No amount of first-party agreement
could have surfaced that; the outside implementation surfaced it immediately.

## Reference corpus

`vectors/MANIFEST.json`, suiteRevision 5: **149 vectors (35 accept, 114 reject)**.
Each accept vector must verify valid with its expected `result` token; each reject
vector must be invalid with a failure code drawn from the manifest's code set. The
corpus is regenerated deterministically from the generators and its vendored spec
digest is pinned and CI-checked (`scripts/spec-drift-gate.py`).

## Implementations

| Implementation | Language | Author | Verified against | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reference rail (`aee/`) | Go | spec author | reference corpus, suiteRevision 5 | **149 / 149** |
| Reference rail (`packaging/run_vectors.py`) | Python | spec author | reference corpus, suiteRevision 5 | **149 / 149** |
| `Rul1an/aee-checker` | Rust | **independent, from-spec text alone** | last author-run suiteRevision 3 (140), 2026-07-26; suiteRevision 5 not run by its author | **140 / 140** at suiteRevision 3; suiteRevision 5 not run by author (see note 1) |
| `@consumer-core/verify` | TypeScript | spec author | its vendored set (140 vectors) + cross-rail parity tests | pass (see note 2) |
| `consumer-core-verify.py` | Python | spec author | its vendored set (140 vectors) + parity tests | pass (see note 2) |
| consumer-mcp `_aee.py` | Python | spec author | its vendored set (140 vectors) + parity tests | pass (see note 2) |

The five first-party rails are separate decompositions rather than shared code, so
they do catch each other's transcription errors, and the differential fuzzer over
them catches drift. What they cannot catch is a misreading of the specification,
because they inherit one. Read their agreement as a drift check, not as
corroboration.

The Rust checker is the load-bearing result: built from the spec text alone, with
its own I-JSON parser, RFC 8785 serializer, RFC 6962 Merkle root over DSSE PAE,
run-binding derivation, and Ed25519 tier, with no sight of the reference
implementation and no reading of the corpus condition codes.

## Feature coverage

Two eras. The **core** predicate and the **round-7** additions have both been read
independently: the from-spec Rust checker re-ran against the round-7 corpus
(suiteRevision 2) and reached 138/138 after a spec-diff-led update (132/138 on the
unchanged build), then cleared the suiteRevision-3 corpus at 140/140 with the same
build. That is one independent reading of each era, corroborated by the first-party
rails rather than the other way round. The **suiteRevision-4 and -5** additions —
the encoding-well-formedness and nesting-bound vectors `bad-733` through `bad-741` —
post-date the Rust checker's latest author-run, so those rules currently have no
independent reading at all and are covered by first-party rails alone.

## Notes (the honest scoping)

1. **The author's run history, each record content-digest-bound in his own
   provenance index.** A blind first run at suiteRevision 1 scored 125/125. At
   suiteRevision 2 the unchanged build scored 132/138 and a spec-diff-led update
   reached 138/138 — the six diverging vectors were exactly the round-7 changes (two
   of which were defects in the checker, the rest spec-boundary adoptions). At
   suiteRevision 3 the same build cleared 140/140. The author is explicit that every
   pass after the first was not blind (the changelog was read before implementing),
   unlike the 125/125.

   **His last author-run is suiteRevision 3 at 140/140 (2026-07-26). He has not run
   suiteRevision 4 or 5, so this report publishes no suiteRevision-5 score in his
   column.** What we can say, in our own voice and not his: the suiteRevision-5
   vector `bad-741-payload-nesting-exceeds-max-depth` pins a normative nesting bound
   of 128, and his build's bound is 256, so we expect his current build to answer
   valid where the reference rails answer invalid on that one vector — a one-constant
   update on his side. That is our derivation of a rule difference, not a run he
   produced, and it is not a score we will report as his. The honest cell for his
   column at suiteRevision 5 is "not run by author", and it stays that way until he
   posts a record and its source digest.
2. **The consumer rails carry the round-7 rules but their vendored vector sets lag
   the reference corpus** (consumer-core 140, mcp 140 vs the reference 149). The rules
   themselves are verified by cross-rail parity tests plus each rail's own suite
   and mutation checks; a full re-vendor of the byte-level tier (`bad-733` through
   `bad-741`) into consumer-core and mcp is tracked as a follow-up. Until then, "pass"
   means the rail implements and is parity-tested on the rule, not that it replayed
   the full 149.

## What this report does NOT claim

One independent implementation agreeing is strong evidence the text is
determinate; it is not proof it is unambiguous. Two readers can share a
reasonable but unforced reading, and a single outside reader is a sample of one.
Nor does agreement on 149 vectors say anything about the surface no vector
touches, which is where the nesting-depth divergence above lived. The
interpretation-decision registry
(`vectors/interpretation-decisions.json`) records where the text forces the reading
and locks each with a vector; every decision it carries is now classified `forced`
and its open-corner list is empty. The three corners that were once open — duplicate
`attackId`, subject cardinality, and the coverage partition — are each resolved into
a forced decision with a forcing vector; the coverage partition is the single
editorial call kept reversible at vetting, with the audit trail in
`docs/interpretation-decisions-open.md`. This report is a determinacy claim about
the corpus surface, not a security claim about any assessed artifact.
