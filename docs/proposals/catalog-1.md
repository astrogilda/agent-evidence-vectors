# catalog#1: four findings against `anchors-verify-v0.10`

## Front matter

| field | value |
|---|---|
| **target** | `https://github.com/aos-standard/catalog/issues/1`, a comment on the open issue "Break our ANCHORS verifier -- pinned tag anchors-verify-v0.4" |
| **channel** | GitHub issue comment, posted by the operator |
| **deadline** | none stated. The issue's own rules of engagement say "No response in 21 days -> we treat that as 'no takers yet', not as evidence of strength." Verified by reading the issue body, captured 2026-09-09 as a private JSON capture of the issue |
| **audience** | Tetsurohhori (the maintainer, 15 of the 21 comments). Two others have taken the invitation and both post reproduction receipts: `mohammedmessaoudene-cmd` (5 comments) and `wowlegend`, signing as Tersign (4 comments). Everything posted here will be re-run by at least one of them |
| **identity** | Private individual, the operator's own name. **No repository link of any kind appears in the body**, per the adversarial-submission rule in the project instructions: every payload is inline and reproduces from the pinned tag plus the script quoted in the comment |

### Evidence status of every number and quotation

| The proposed repairs | `proposal` | this file |

### push_plan

1. The operator reads the issue in full once before posting; the comment quotes it four times.
2. Post the body below as a single comment. Nothing else is sent.
3. Told next: nobody outside. The corpus that produced these figures stays where it is and is not named.
4. Follow-up cadence: if he replies with a repair, re-run the same script against the new tag and post the table again, which is the exchange the two other reporters have already established in this thread. If nobody replies in 21 days, his own rules of engagement have already said what that means and no nudge is sent.

## Paste-ready body

Paragraphs are single lines with a blank line between them, so GitHub renders prose.

Four constructions against `anchors-verify-v0.10`, and the first one is the copy-paste block at the top of `ANCHORS_VERIFY.md`. Run it today and it exits 1, not 3.

```
VERIFY FAILED: truncation vector 2: presented stream shorter than main branch (24 vs 49 lines)
```

I ran that block against all 7 published tags, `v0.4` through `v0.10`, and recorded exit 1 from every one. The bundled stream has not changed and the verifier has not changed. `main` went from 24 lines to 49.

Two lines in `verify_from_bytes` are what I take to be the cause, and they are unchanged since `v0.4`:

```python
if main_lines is None and query_repo:
    main_lines = fetch_repo_lines(query_repo, "main", "ANCHORS.jsonl")
```

That fetch has no condition on it, so the documented run reads a moving branch. Your own text beside the block says "The bundled files come from the same tag as the verifier. You can reproduce without referencing `main`." The verdict a reader gets from those commands is a function of what you pushed this week.

The remaining three run offline, because the alternative is a live fetch and a verdict that depends on one expires. Fetch `anchors_verify.py`, `ANCHORS.jsonl` and `ANCHORS.jsonl.digests.json` from the tag, add the two witness snapshots the stream names, and run the script below. It reproduces the outcome path of your `main` with the platform reads replaced by pinned bytes, and nothing else stubbed.

```

```

Row 2 is the construction for H1 you asked for on 13 August: "If you have a construction for either, I will take it." Delete the final newline byte and keep the published sidecar.

The stream's sha256 moves from `d0a5857384624bab` to `c3c80b8a0b725331`, and the verifier prints the baseline's line word for word on all 7 tags. `bytes_to_lines` appends the missing terminator before hashing, so the digest that matched was computed over a line the file does not contain. `ANCHORS_VERIFY.md` says "Hashes cover the full stored line including the trailing newline byte." On the last line of this stream they cover a byte that is not there.

Rows 3 and 4 are the digest sidecar's coverage. `verify_lines_against_digests` fails closed when the sidecar is longer than the stream and iterates over `digests` when it is shorter, so 6 lines get no comparison at all.

Row 4 alters line 22 inside that gap. It returns the same outcome and the same exit code as the honest stream. The `digests=18` field does move, and by my reading that is the whole signal: a reader has to notice one field, on a line whose verdict word and exit code are identical, to learn that a quarter of the stream went unchecked. Your limits section puts fork detection at the unattested tip out of scope, which is a different claim from this one, and nothing in it says the sidecar may cover part of the file.

Row 5 is `_resolve_trust_repo`. With `--expect-witness-repo` supplied, the comparison is guarded on the stream's repository being truthy, and the empty string is not, so a binding that names no repository at all satisfies the pin.

`ANCHORS_VERIFY.md` says "If `--expect-witness-repo` is set and the stream names a different repository -> fail closed." The empty string is not a different repository, so that branch never runs. I have not shown a witness substitution here. The query still goes to the pinned repository, so what this breaks is the comparison rather than the fetch, and it is the narrowest of the four and the cheapest to close.

The repairs, in the order I would land them. Compare the presented stream against the pinned witness commit and stop fetching `main`, or say in the outcome that the verdict was taken against a branch and name the commit it stood at. Refuse a sidecar that does not cover every presented line, with its own stop reason, because "shorter" and "longer" are different failures and only one of them is caught today.

Split lines on the delimiter over raw bytes with no terminator appended, so a final line without one fails rather than being repaired into a line that hashes. Treat a falsy witness repository in a binding as absent and fail closed on it.

One thing about how I ran these, since it bears on what the numbers mean. Every construction carries a stop reason as well as a verdict and the runner scores both, because of what you wrote on 20 August: "any branch that can emit a verdict without evaluating the property must say so in the verdict itself. That is testable -- assert on the stop reason, not the verdict column."

Scored that way, one member turns up an instance of exactly that in your own history. A binding whose `byte_length` is JSON `true` is a type error, and from `v0.4` through `v0.8` the verifier reached the correct verdict from a value comparison instead:

```
position binding at line 19: witness prefix byte length 164 does not equal attested True
```

Right answer, and the type check it appears to be enforcing never ran. `v0.9` stops at `invalid byte_length`. A run scoring the verdict column alone reports both tags as passes and cannot tell you which one closed anything.

Which leaves one question for you. The four repairs above turn streams that return `PARTIAL` today into `FAILED`, so by your own convention they ship as a new tag and `v0.10` stays where it is.

Do you want the four separately, so each is a tag whose diff is one rule, or in one? I would rather match the shape you already use than pick for you.
