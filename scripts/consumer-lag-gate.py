"""Consumer-lag gate: this corpus may not move without the copies of it moving.

The corpus is authored here and vendored byte-for-byte into the consumer rails
that replay it. Each rail keeps a stamp recording a content digest over the
vectors it carries, and each rail's own build recomputes that digest and fails
if a vendored file was edited. That half was wired and it works.

The other half was not wired at all. Nothing anywhere asked whether a rail's
copy was the current corpus, so the refresh ran when somebody remembered, and
twice it was not remembered: two rails sat at 140 vectors while this repository
published 149, and by the next revision they sat at 154 and 153 against 165. A
timestamp profile enforced on every rail and published in the manifest was
pinned by no vector any consumer replayed. The gap is not that anyone ignored a
red build. There was no red build to ignore.

No build can see two repositories at once, so the check has to live where the
change that causes the lag happens, which is here. This gate compares the corpus
each rail is recorded as carrying in ``vectors/CONSUMERS.json`` against the
corpus the DEFAULT BRANCH publishes, and fails naming any copy that is behind.
A corpus change therefore reddens this repository from the moment it lands on
the default branch until every rail has been refreshed, rather than leaving a
lag that only shows up when someone thinks to count files in another tree.

The reference is the default branch and not the checked-out tree, and that
distinction is the whole of this gate's timing.

A rail vendors what this repository has published. It cannot vendor a branch
nobody has merged, because there is nothing to fetch: the branch tip is not
reachable from the remote's default branch and a vendoring script pointed at it
would record a digest describing a commit that may never exist anywhere else.
So a branch that adds vectors creates no obligation on any rail while it is a
branch, and measuring against the checked-out tree invented one -- it demanded
that the rails already carry a corpus they had no way to obtain.

That is not a strict gate, it is a deadlock, and it was reached: the push of a
branch bumping the corpus was refused because the rails were behind that
branch, the rails could only be refreshed from a published corpus, and the
corpus could not be published because the push was refused. A gate that cannot
be satisfied before the action it gates is unsatisfiable by construction, and
the only thing an unsatisfiable gate teaches is the bypass flag.

Measured against the default branch the obligation is preserved and arrives
when it becomes real. While the change is a branch, the default branch still
publishes the old corpus, the rails carry it, and the gate is green. The
instant the change lands, the default branch publishes the new corpus, every
rail is genuinely behind, and the gate is red on the default branch and stays
red until the rails are refreshed and the ledger records it. Nothing here can
clear that: the ledger digests are read from the copies, so regenerating the
corpus, re-deriving a digest or re-running any generator moves the reference
further from the ledger rather than closer to it.

What the default branch publishes is read from that branch's own tree, with the
same digest function applied to the same files, and not from the ``corpusDigest``
field it happens to carry. A field is a leftover until something recomputes it,
and trusting one here would let a default branch whose manifest was never
regenerated hand this gate a stale reference that every stale copy then agrees
with. The field is checked against those files instead, so a default branch that
does not publish the corpus it has fails here, naming the default branch rather
than the branch being pushed.

The ledger identifies each copy by an opaque id and records nothing else about
it. Which checkout an id refers to is supplied on the command line at sync time
and never written down here, because this repository is the artifact offered in
standards correspondence and it stays neutral about who consumes it. The gate
does not need to know: it needs to know how many copies exist and what each one
carries.

The two modes are deliberately asymmetric.

``--check`` is what CI runs. It reads this repository and nothing else, so it
needs no sibling checkout, no credential and no network. It does need the
default branch's ref to be present locally, which is why the workflow that runs
it checks out with full history; when that ref cannot be resolved the check
reports that it did not run, and never that the copies are current.

``--sync`` rewrites the ledger, and it does so by reading each rail's own stamp
rather than by writing down the digest it just computed here. That distinction
is the whole reason the ledger is trustworthy: a sync that copied this
repository's digest into the ledger would make the check a function of its own
input, so it could never fail and the ledger would record an intention instead
of a fact. Reading the rail means a sync run against a stale copy records the
stale digest and the check stays red. The only way to green is to actually
refresh the copy, which is the outcome the gate exists to force.

``--sync`` also refuses to guess where a copy lives. Every id in the ledger must
be given a directory on the command line, because these repositories have linked
worktrees on different branches sitting beside each other, and a sync that
silently read the wrong tree would record a digest describing a checkout nobody
is shipping. An id given a directory that the ledger does not yet carry is added
to it, with its digest read from that copy's stamp like every other row. That is
the only way to widen this ledger, and it exists because the alternative was
adding a row by hand to a file whose own comment says not to: a rail nobody
registered is a rail this gate reports success about, so registering one had to
be a command rather than an edit.

The other half of the gate is that the ledger is what the published prose says.
``docs/IMPLEMENTATION-REPORT.md`` states, in a note and in one cell per rail, how
many vectors the rails vendor and at which revision. Those sentences were written
by hand at suiteRevision 6 and were still saying so at suiteRevision 14, through
eight re-vendors that moved every copy underneath them, because nothing read
them. So each is declared below and matched on the fixed words around its number
against the corpus this repository publishes -- the same discipline
``scripts/independent-runs-gate.py`` applies to the independence column, applied
here to the ledger that owns this fact rather than folded into that gate, which
would give one gate two unrelated ledgers and two unrelated failure vocabularies.

One of those checks is not about a number. The report names one rail per cell,
and the count of those cells must equal the count of rows in the ledger, so a
rail advertised in the table with nothing recorded about it fails here. That is
the hole this half was built for: the table named three rails, the ledger carried
two, and the missing one was the one no copy of this corpus was ever compared
against.

What it does not catch: a merge that lands and is never followed by a refresh
goes red here and stays red, which is the intended outcome, but it goes red on
the default branch rather than on the change that caused it. The branch that
bumped the corpus passed, correctly, because at the time it was checked no rail
was behind anything. Whoever merges owns the refresh, and the only signal that
they do is a red default branch. Nothing in this repository can make that
signal arrive earlier without demanding a rail vendor an unpublished commit,
which is the deadlock above.

Nor does it catch a copy that is refreshed, synced here, and then
reverted. The ledger would still name the digest that copy carried at sync time,
and this gate would stay green until the next sync. The rail's own stamp check
does not catch it either, since a revert plus a re-stamp is internally
consistent. Closing it needs this repository to read the rail, which is the
cross-repository read this gate is built to avoid, so it is recorded here rather
than papered over. Nor does the cell count see a vendored copy that no document
advertises and no row records: the report and the ledger would agree with each
other, and the copy would be invisible to both.
