"""Accepted-complexity gate, for both rails.

Two files record the functions whose cyclomatic complexity is accepted as
inherent, each entry pairing a measured number with a hand-written rationale.
``docs/architecture/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`` carries the Go table;
``docs/complexity-rationales.toml`` carries the Python entries, one per function
marked ``# noqa: C901``. The rationale is the point of both: it is the argument
that a branch-heavy function mirrors a branch-heavy specification rather than
tangled structure. That argument is only worth reading if the number attached to
it is the number a reader gets when they measure.

The numbers drift because nothing checks them, and they have now drifted on both
rails. On the Go side, as gocyclo measured them at suiteRevision 15, ``Gate0``
grew from 33 to 34 and ``evaluateKind`` from 24 to 28 without a check going red,
and two functions crossed the inclusion
threshold without ever being written down. The Python side was described here and
in ``DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`` as already covered, on the reasoning that ruff's C901
fails the build; that reasoning was wrong, and the correction is the reason this
gate now spans both rails. C901 fires on functions above the threshold, and the
recorded functions are exactly the ones carrying ``# noqa: C901``, which silences
it. Nothing then read the recorded number at all: ``verify`` grew from 38 to 45
and ``second_fault_absence`` from 11 to 12 under a linter that was, correctly,
saying nothing about either.

It fails closed on all three ways a record can go out of sync with the source,
identically on both rails:

  - an entry whose number no longer matches what the analyzer measures;
  - a function at or above the inclusion threshold with no entry (an unreviewed
    accepted-complexity function, which is exactly what these records exist to
    prevent);
  - an entry for a function that no longer exists, or that has been refactored
    back below the threshold (a rationale for complexity that is no longer
    there).

On the Python rail it also fails when a recorded function has lost its
``# noqa: C901`` marker, so the source comment and the record keep pointing at
each other.

Scope and threshold are stated for each rail rather than inferred from the
records, so the rule is checkable instead of archaeological:

  - GO SCOPE -- every non-test Go function in the four source trees. Test helpers
    are excluded: they are not the shipped verifier, and their branch count is
    driven by the number of cases they enumerate.
  - GO THRESHOLD -- complexity 18 and above. Below that, a function is ordinary
    and needs no defence.
  - PYTHON SCOPE -- every function in the three trees ruff lints in CI.
  - PYTHON THRESHOLD -- one above ``max-complexity`` in ``pyproject.toml``, read
    from that file rather than repeated here, because the threshold that matters
    is the one the linter enforces and two copies of it would be one more number
    free to drift.

``--sync`` rewrites the numbers from a fresh measurement and touches nothing
else, so a legitimate complexity change is one command rather than a hand edit
that can typo a digit. It deliberately cannot add or remove an entry: a new
accepted-complexity function needs a rationale a script has no way to write, and
inventing a placeholder would defeat the record. Membership stays a human
decision; only the arithmetic is automated.

``--rail`` selects which half to run, because the two analyzers come from
different toolchains and CI splits the work across two jobs: the Go job has
gocyclo and the Python job has ruff. A bare run does both, which is what a
developer with the full toolchain wants.

Note the argument convention is the majority one in this directory (bare run =
check, fail closed), not ``coverage-matrix-gate.py``'s (bare run = regenerate),
because this is a gate that can regenerate rather than a generator that can
check.

Usage: python3 scripts/complexity-table-gate.py
           [--rail go|python|both] [--sync] [--gocyclo PATH] [--ruff PATH]
Exit 0 when every record matches its source; 1 on any drift.
