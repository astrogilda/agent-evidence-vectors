"""Re-derive the published weak-spot figure, independently of the tool that wrote it.

`scripts/condition-forcing-gate.py --check` proves that `docs/FORCING-HONESTY.md`
has not drifted from the data. That is a real property and it is not the one a
reader wants. The generator regenerates the page and compares; if its reading of
the definitions is wrong, the page is wrong and the comparison agrees with it.
Self-consistency cannot see that, by construction.

So this is a second implementation, written from the definitions AS THE PAGE
STATES THEM rather than from the generator's source, sharing no code with it:

    forced    -- some weakening is caught by that condition's vectors and by no
                 others: the killer set is a subset of the condition's vectors.
    weak      -- it intersects a killer set but is a subset of none.
    unforced  -- it intersects no killer set at all.

It reads the two primary inputs, recomputes, then reads the PROSE back out of
the published page -- the headline sentence, the provenance row, the campaign
totals and every row of the weak table -- and refuses on any disagreement. A
figure confirmed only by the program that produced it is the defect this whole
document exists to remove, so the confirmation is not allowed to come from
there either.

`--with-prior` extends that to the earlier figure and to the reconciliation
between the two runs. The page claims an exact identity -- the pinned
baseline's killed count equals the released note's, plus the kills that need
vectors added later, plus the kills only a no-key pass can observe -- and an
identity is the easiest kind of claim to make come out right by choosing the
terms. So the third term is re-derived here from the pinned baseline, the
addition is checked, and the page is then required to state all four numbers
and name every site.

    python3 scripts/condition-forcing-crosscheck.py
    python3 scripts/condition-forcing-crosscheck.py --with-prior   # needs a full clone
    python3 scripts/condition-forcing-crosscheck.py --print        # numbers, no comparison

Exit 0 only when every published number follows from the data. 1 when the page
and the data disagree; 2 when an input could not be read, which is never
reported as agreement.
