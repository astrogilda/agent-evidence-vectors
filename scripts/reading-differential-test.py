"""Mutation proof for ``reading-differential.py``.

A harness whose whole purpose is to refuse silence has to be shown refusing it,
because the failure it exists to prevent is a run that returned nothing and was
read as confirmation. Every case below drives the REAL gate against a rigged
copy of ``spec/READINGS.toml`` and asserts it goes red with a NAMED phrase.

Two guards make the cases mean something, and both were earned elsewhere in this
repository:

  * a mutation that changes nothing is a hard failure, never a pass. Each case
    hashes the ledger text before and after and refuses when they match, so an
    edit that silently missed cannot report success. A line count cannot see a
    one-value-for-one-value swap, which is why the check is a digest.
  * the control asserts the UNMUTATED ledger passes, so a gate that fails on
    everything cannot masquerade as a gate that catches these.

Six of the cases were written by attacking the gate rather than by reading it,
and each of those names the result the unpatched gate returned: a ledger can
otherwise flag the edited side as the implemented one, express a rival in the
replay driver instead of the rail, address a real witness to a registry decision
about other text, or claim an authority-text digest nothing ever compared.

The cases that need a Go build share one per-vector coverage sweep through
``--reach-cache``, which is keyed on the rail source digest and the corpus
fingerprint. A cache that could go stale silently would be a second way to
manufacture an absence, so a miss re-measures rather than assuming.

Usage: python3 scripts/reading-differential-test.py
       python3 scripts/reading-differential-test.py --fast   # skip the Go cases
Exit 0 when every case behaves; 1 otherwise.
