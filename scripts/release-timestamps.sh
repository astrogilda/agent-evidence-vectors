# Time evidence for a signed corpus release: RFC 3161 and OpenTimestamps.
#
# WHAT IS STAMPED, AND WHY IT IS THE SIGNATURE RATHER THAN THE DIGEST LIST.
# Both proofs are taken over the RAW SIGNATURE BYTES of
# release/CORPUS-DIGESTS.txt.sig, not over the digest list. A timestamp over the
# list would establish that those bytes existed by some time; it would say
# nothing about when the maintainer committed to them, and the whole claim being
# made is about the commitment. Stamping the signature dates the commitment, and
# the commitment already binds the list. The files are therefore named after
# what they cover -- `CORPUS-DIGESTS.txt.sig.tsr`, `CORPUS-DIGESTS.txt.sig.ots`
# -- because a proof named after a file it does not cover is a proof a verifier
# will point at the wrong bytes.
#
# THE TWO ARE NOT REDUNDANT. The RFC 3161 token is an assertion by a named
# authority, checkable offline against a pinned root, and worth exactly the
# authority's honesty and key hygiene. The OpenTimestamps proof is an anchor
# into a public chain that nobody in this repository can rewrite, and it is
# worth nothing until it confirms. One is trusted and immediate, the other is
# trustless and slow, so a release carries both.
#
# PENDING IS A STATE, NOT A FAILURE. A fresh OpenTimestamps proof is an
# attestation by the calendars that they received the digest; the Bitcoin
# attestation lands roughly a day later, which is what `upgrade` (and the weekly
# workflow that calls it) is for. `ots verify` exits non-zero on a pending
# proof, so this script distinguishes the two by reading the output rather than
# by trusting the status alone, and prints which one it saw. What is checked
# OFFLINE and unconditionally is the binding: the digest inside the .ots must
# equal the sha256 of the raw signature. That check is the one an attacker would
# have to beat, and it does not depend on any network.
#
#   scripts/release-timestamps.sh stamp     # obtain both proofs (network)
#   scripts/release-timestamps.sh upgrade   # move a pending .ots forward (network)
#   scripts/release-timestamps.sh verify    # check both proofs
#
# Exit 0 on success. `upgrade` exits 0 when there is nothing to upgrade and when
# the proof is still pending: neither is a defect, and a weekly job that goes red
# for the passage of time teaches its reader to ignore it.
