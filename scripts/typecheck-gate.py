"""Type-check every Python file in the repository, and prove it checked them.

This repository asks a stranger to run its gates and reach the same answer, so
a gate that dies partway is worse than one that answers wrongly: a crash and a
never-wired check produce the same thing, which is no finding at all. The lint
pass covers the compiled rail. Nothing covered the interpreted one.

Three properties, and each exists because its absence is a way this gate could
report a clean result it did not earn.

FIRST, coverage is by directory and is checked, not assumed. The other type
pass runs from a list of files spelled out by hand at its call site, so a file
is covered only if somebody remembered to add it; four had accumulated that no
checker had ever read, including this directory's own workflow runner and the
locking primitive under it. Here the checked set comes from the directories in
[tool.pyright].include, and any Python file in the repository that falls
outside them is a CONFIGURATION error -- the gate refuses rather than quietly
checking less than it appears to.

SECOND, an unresolved import is a CONFIGURATION error, never a finding. It
means the environment lacks a package or the search path is short, and it is
reported against the file doing the importing, where it reads exactly like a
real undefined name. A gate that emits a page of that on every run is a gate
its readers learn to scroll past, and the genuine findings underneath go with
it. So they exit separately, with the command that fixes them.

THIRD, a run that analysed nothing is not a pass. Point a checker at a path
that does not resolve and it reports zero problems, cheerfully, in
milliseconds -- the same output as a clean tree. So the analysed-file count is
compared against the files this repository actually has, and a shortfall fails.

    uv run python scripts/typecheck-gate.py           # check
    uv run python scripts/typecheck-gate.py --list    # show the set, check nothing

Exits: 0 clean, 1 type findings, 2 configuration error.
