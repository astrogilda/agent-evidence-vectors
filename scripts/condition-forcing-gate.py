"""Publish what this suite does NOT force, per normative condition and per code.

Why a second projection of one campaign
---------------------------------------
`docs/FORCING-BASELINE.json` records a mutation campaign over the reference Go
rail: switch one rule off, replay the whole corpus, record whether any vector
notices. The baseline is keyed by MUTATION SITE, and a site is a fact about the
rail's source, not about the specification. A reader asking "which of the rules
in the document does this corpus oblige me to implement" cannot answer it from a
site list, because the document does not have sites -- it has conditions, and the
corpus cites them by `aee-c-NN` id on every vector.

So there are two ways to read one campaign, and both are legitimate:

  the SITE axis        already published: how many single-site weakenings of the
                       rail the corpus catches, tolerates, or does not depend on
  the CONDITION axis   this file: for each normative condition the corpus cites,
                       whether any weakening is caught by the vectors citing that
                       condition and by NO other vector

The second was measured once, over an earlier and smaller corpus, and quoted
afterwards beside the first. Two projections of one campaign taken at two corpus
revisions look exactly like two measurements that disagree, and neither of them
is wrong. This gate ends that by deriving the condition projection from the
published baseline on every run, so the two can never again be quoted from
different dates.

The earlier figure gets the same treatment rather than a footnote. It was seven
integers typed into this file, which is the shape of a number a reader has to
take on trust; `--verify-prior` now re-derives it from two pinned git objects
and refuses anything but a match. See the reconstruction section below for what
the reconstruction is exact about and what it is silent about.

Where the two runs disagreed, they now reconcile by arithmetic rather than by
argument. The reconstruction counts three more killed weakenings than the
released note does over the same sites and the same vectors, and all three sit
on the branch a verifier takes when the consumer supplies no substrate key
policy -- a branch no run without a no-key pass can observe, which the run
behind the note did not make. `--verify-prior` derives that set from the pinned
baseline, checks it against the set the record names, and checks that the
subtraction lands on the note's figure with no slack. What it cannot check is
stated on the page beside the number: the earlier campaign's own per-site table
is not in this repository, so this is an exact closure over a derived set and
not a per-site diff.

What the three classes mean, exactly
------------------------------------
For a condition `c`, let `V(c)` be the vectors that cite it and `K` the sites the
baseline records as KILLED, each with the set of vectors that killed it.

  FORCED    some killed site's killer set is a SUBSET of `V(c)`. Delete those
            vectors and that weakening goes undetected. The condition's vectors
            are load-bearing.
  WEAK      `V(c)` kills something, but every site it kills is also killed by a
            vector outside `V(c)`. The rule is covered, redundantly, and nothing
            in the corpus is uniquely attributable to this condition.
  UNFORCED  `V(c)` kills nothing at all. The corpus cites the rule and does not
            oblige anyone to implement it.

WEAK is therefore a statement about ATTRIBUTION, not about strength, and it is
not monotone: adding a vector that happens to kill a site can enlarge that site's
killer set past `V(c)` and move `c` from FORCED to WEAK while the corpus got
strictly better. A reader who diffs two of these figures across revisions and
reads a rise in WEAK as a regression has read the wrong thing, and the generated
document says so where the number is.

The code axis, and why only one mutation operator is admissible for it
----------------------------------------------------------------------
"Can a conforming rail decline to emit this failure code at all" is a third
question, and the operator that answers it is `CODE_OFF`, which removes exactly
one `appendCode` call and nothing else. `IF_OFF` is inadmissible here even though
its snippet names the same code: it removes the whole enclosing statement, so on
a parse block it deletes the field parse as well and is killed by most of the
corpus for a reason that has nothing to do with the code inside it. Deriving the
code axis from every site that mentions a code reports one of this repository's
own published weak spots as forced. It is measured from `CODE_OFF` alone.

Some emissions pass the code through a variable (`appendCode(codes, c)` inside a
shared helper). Those sites name no code, and the codes reached only that way are
reported as NOT MEASURABLE on this axis rather than folded into either answer,
for the same reason the baseline keeps INCONCLUSIVE apart from DEAD: "we could
not measure it" and "the corpus does not force it" are different claims.

Usage:
    scripts/condition-forcing-gate.py                  # regenerate the document
    scripts/condition-forcing-gate.py --check          # fail on drift, write nothing
    scripts/condition-forcing-gate.py --verify-prior   # re-derive the earlier figure
    scripts/condition-forcing-gate.py --sync-prior     # write it, from its own pins
Exit 0 when the document is current; 1 on drift; 2 when an input cannot be read
or an attribution cannot be resolved. Nothing here needs a Go toolchain: the
campaign has already run and its record is in the repository. The two prior
modes read git, so they need a full clone and they stop rather than pass without
one.

    others. Delete them and that weakening goes undetected.
-   **weak** -- they catch weakenings, but every one is also caught by a vector
    citing something else. The rule is covered; nothing is uniquely attributable

-   **not forced** -- they catch no weakening at all.

**Weak is a statement about attribution, not about strength, and it does not move
in one direction.** Adding a vector that happens to catch an already-caught
weakening enlarges that weakening's killer set, which can move a condition from
forced to weak while the corpus got strictly better. Two of these figures from

_REQUIREMENT_PREAMBLE = """\
A third register, kept separately because it answers a different question. The condition
axis above asks what a vector forces; `vectors/coverage-unforced.json` asks, requirement by
requirement, whether a self-contained vector could pin it at all, and
`docs/COVERAGE-MATRIX.md` carries the rows. The counts are here so this page is the whole
answer and the matrix stays the detail."""

_WEAK_PREAMBLE = """\
Each of these conditions is cited by live vectors that catch real weakenings of
the rail. What none of them has is a weakening that its vectors alone catch. The
practical reading: a third-party verifier could get the rule in this row wrong in
some way this corpus does not separate from a neighbouring rule, and still pass.
The `kills it shares` column is how many weakenings its vectors catch alongside
somebody else's."""

_NO_UNFORCED = """\
None. Every condition this corpus cites is caught by at least one of its own
vectors. That is the one place this measurement comes out better than the
headline suggests, and it is stated with the same weight as the rest."""

_CODE_PREAMBLE = """\
A separate question, and a harder one: can a conforming verifier decline to emit a
failure code at all? It is measured with the one mutation operator that removes exactly
one emission and nothing else, because the operator that removes the enclosing statement
takes a field parse down with it on a parse block and is then killed for a reason that has
nothing to do with the code inside. In the campaign recorded above, removing any single
emission below left every vector passing, so nothing in this suite obliges an implementer
to produce these codes."""

_ANNOTATION_PREAMBLE = """\
Two kinds of site are recorded in the baseline as unkillable rather than unforced,
because writing a vector for them is wasted work. `unkillable` is a true
equivalent mutant: the weakened rail computes exactly what the original computes,
on every input. `masked` is a real rule that an earlier check reaches first on
every input that could get to it, so it cannot be forced as the corpus and the
rail stand. Both are claims about the world and the forcing gate falsifies them:
an annotated site that is ever killed fails the build."""

_LIMITS = """\
-   **It is a property of a pair.** Forcing is measured against one reference
    rail. A rule this corpus does not force on that rail might still be forced on
    another whose control flow differs, and the reverse.
-   **A weakening operator is not an attacker.** The campaign removes guards,
    disjuncts, conjuncts, emissions and boolean returns one at a time. A verifier
    wrong in a way no single-site weakening expresses is not measured here.
-   **The condition classes cannot be compared across revisions.** See the
    definition above: attribution depends on the rest of the corpus, so the
    classification is only meaningful against the inputs named in the provenance
    table.
-   **Some codes are not measured at all**, and are listed above rather than
    assumed either way.
-   **The unmeasurable sites stay unmeasurable.** The baseline's INCONCLUSIVE
    class is mutants that did not generate, build, terminate or run cleanly.
    Nothing is asserted about them and they are never folded into a gap count."""

The first command reads only files in this repository and needs nothing
installed. It is the one to run when checking a number quoted from here. The
second, third and fourth read history, so a shallow clone makes them stop
rather than pass.

The first command proves only that this page has not drifted from the data,
which is a weaker property than it sounds: the generator regenerates the page
and compares, so a generator that read the definitions wrongly would produce a
wrong page and then agree with it. The crosscheck is the answer to that. It
implements the three definitions above independently, recomputes from
`vectors/MANIFEST.json` and `docs/FORCING-BASELINE.json`, and then reads the
headline sentence, the provenance rows and every weak row back out of this page
and refuses on any disagreement."""
