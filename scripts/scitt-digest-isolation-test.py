"""`release-digests.py --check` must run for somebody who installed nothing.

The property, and why it needs a test rather than a comment
-----------------------------------------------------------
Verifying a published release is the one path in this repository that cannot
have dependencies. A reader clones the tag, runs the four commands the README
lists, and decides whether to trust the corpus. The first of those four is
`python3 scripts/release-digests.py --check`, and it reaches into every corpus
to recompute that corpus's digest from its own files.

v0.10.0 shipped with that property broken. Registering the six newer corpora
made the script load each one's generator by path, and vectors-scitt-cose's
generator imports cbor2 and pycose at module scope -- it registers a COSE
algorithm with a decorator that runs at import time, so the import cannot be
deferred. In a fresh clone the command died with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cbor2'`. Nothing caught it, because every
environment that ran the check had the generator extras installed.

So this asserts the property from outside: the check runs in a subprocess whose
interpreter cannot see site-packages at all, and it has to exit 0 there. A
comment saying "keep this stdlib-only" would not have failed when the dependency
arrived; this does.

The isolation is `-S` (no site directories) plus a PYTHONPATH and a PYTHONHOME
left unset, which together remove every installed package from the subprocess's
view while leaving the standard library reachable. A positive control proves the
isolation is real rather than merely asserted: importing a third-party package
under the same flags must FAIL, or the test is measuring nothing and says so.
