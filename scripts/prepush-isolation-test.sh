# The case this exists for is the second one below, and it is the one the old
# hook waved through in silence: a commit that violates a gate, plus an
# uncommitted edit that repairs the violation. The old hook read the repaired
# working tree, went green, and let a red commit reach the remote. Nothing about
# that failure was visible from inside a push -- there was no output, no warning
# and no slow step, because the gate genuinely passed. It was just answering a
# question about a tree nobody was pushing.
#
# The hook under test is run against a throwaway repository, never against this
# one, and nothing is ever pushed anywhere: git's own hook protocol is fed on
# stdin and git's own hook environment is exported, which is all a real push
# does that the hook can observe.

#     scripts/prepush-isolation-test.sh /path/to/hook   # test some other hook
#
# The second form is how the fix was verified: run it against the hook as it
# stood before the change and cases 1, 3, 4 and 5 fail; run it against the hook
# as it stands now and all six pass.
