"""Run every declared repair to a fixed point, and refuse a gate that has none.

WHAT THIS IS. `scripts/repairs.toml` names, for each gate that compares a
committed artifact against a regenerable one, the command that regenerates it.
This runs them. It is deliberately small: a fuller version of this idea reads a
gate manifest carrying subjects, jobs, costs and dependencies, and a runner needs
four fields of that. Building one here would have been several hundred lines to
serve three rows, so the registry below is the four fields and nothing else.

WHY A FIXED POINT RATHER THAN A SEQUENCE. The repairs are not independent.
Regenerating the coverage matrix can move a figure the forcing document derives,
so a single pass in a guessed order leaves a second artifact stale and the next
push refuses on a gate that was green a moment ago. Running to convergence
removes the ordering question entirely: repeat until a pass changes nothing.

CONVERGENCE IS OBSERVED, NEVER ASSUMED. Generators are idempotent by intent and
not by proof, and two that disagree would oscillate forever. So the loop is
bounded and REFUSES at the bound rather than reporting the last pass as a
success -- a repair loop that quietly gives up is the failure this file exists
to remove, arriving one level up.

ONE FAILING REPAIR DOES NOT CANCEL THE OTHERS. Each is run independently and its
failure is collected, so a run reports every repair that could not complete
rather than stopping at the first. A gate whose repair needs an argument only the
operator can supply is declared `needs_operator` and is REPORTED, never invented:
running it without that argument would either fail or, worse, write a record of
something nobody measured.
