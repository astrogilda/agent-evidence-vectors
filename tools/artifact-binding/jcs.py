"""RFC 8785 canonicalization, in the one form this contract signs over.

The repository already carries three JCS serializers in
``vectors-ai-agent-action/gen_vectors.py``: a fast one that is correct for
BMP-only member names and safe integers, one that sorts member names by UTF-16
code unit as the RFC actually says, and one that also writes numbers per
ECMA-262 rather than per Python. Only the third is unconditionally correct, and
a binding record is signed over its own bytes, so this module carries that one
and no other. ``es6_number`` below is the same algorithm as the house copy; it
is restated here rather than imported because the corpus generators live under
a directory this tool must not depend on at verification time.

The contract in ``spec/artifact-binding/v1.md`` section 4 says what these bytes
are for: they are the preimage of the manifest digest and of the detached
signature, and a manifest whose stored bytes differ from them is refused before
any signature is checked.
