"""Self-check the SCITT/COSE carriage suite.

    uv run --extra generators python vectors-scitt-cose/check_vectors.py

This is the mutation check the corpus needs to be worth anything, and it asks a
different question from scripts/regenerability-gate.py. That gate asks whether
the committed bytes are the bytes the generator emits. This asks whether those
bytes BEHAVE as the manifest claims: that a member claiming a root divergence
actually diverges, that a member claiming a valid signature actually verifies,
that every reject member carries the specific fault it names and not some other
one, and that every reject condition is also carried by a member that must be
accepted.

The last of those is what makes the suite scoreable at all. A corpus of
refusals gives full marks to a verifier that refuses everything; the accept
twins turn that strategy into a zero.

Nothing here imports the generator. The Merkle verification below is RFC 9162
Section 2.1.3.2 stated a second time, on purpose: a checker that reused the
generator's tree code would produce a corpus and then agree with it, and two
independent statements of the same algorithm is the only arrangement in which
this file can fail.

Exit 0 when every member behaves as its manifest entry claims.
