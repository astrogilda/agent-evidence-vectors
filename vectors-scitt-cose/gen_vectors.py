"""Generate the SCITT/COSE carriage conformance vector suite for the AEE predicate.

Regenerate byte-identically:

    uv run --extra generators python vectors-scitt-cose/gen_vectors.py

Every member is a complete RFC 9943 Transparent Statement: a COSE_Sign1 Signed
Statement carrying an Adversarial Execution Evidence in-toto Statement as its
payload, with one or more RFC 9942 Receipts in its unprotected header. The
vector file carries the bytes and the trust inputs a verifier needs and nothing
else. What the verifier is supposed to DECIDE lives in MANIFEST.json, never
beside the input, for the reason the sibling corpora record: a file that carries
its own answer is scoreable without being read.

WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS AT ALL
----------------------------
RFC 9943, Section 6 says of Signed Statements: "Profiles and implementation-
specific choices should be used to determine admissibility of conforming
messages. This specification is left intentionally open to allow implementations
to make Registration restrictions that make the most sense for their operational
use cases." That openness is deliberate and it is also the whole gap. Two
implementations can both conform to RFC 9943 and disagree about every question
this corpus asks, because the architecture states the mandatory labels and
leaves admissibility to a profile that nobody had written for execution
evidence. profiles/scitt-cose.md is that profile; this directory is what makes
it testable.

DETERMINISM, AND THE ONE THING THAT FORCED THE ALGORITHM CHOICE
---------------------------------------------------------------
scripts/regenerability-gate.py re-runs this generator into a scratch tree and
diffs every file it owns, so a member has to come out byte-identical on every
machine. That rules out randomized signatures: ECDSA draws a per-signature
nonce, so an ES256 corpus would differ on every run and the gate could not tell
a regenerated file from a rewritten one.

Ed25519 signatures are deterministic (RFC 8032), so the corpus is signed with
Ed25519 throughout and the private keys are derived from fixed seeds in this
file. The algorithm IDENTIFIER is -19, the fully-specified Ed25519 registration
of RFC 9864, Section 4.2.1 ("Name: Ed25519, Value: -19, Recommended: Yes"), and
NOT -8. RFC 9864, Section 4.2.2 has IANA update -8 EdDSA and -7 ES256 alike to
"Recommended: Deprecated", which is worth saying plainly because every worked
example in RFC 9943 and RFC 9942 carries `1: -7`: the published examples of the
architecture this profile targets are all on a deprecated identifier.

pycose 1.1.0 ships no -19, so this file registers it through the library's own
extension mechanism (`@CoseAlgorithm.register_attribute()`), reusing EdDSA's
sign and verify. The library still builds every Sig_structure, sorts nothing,
and does all CBOR encoding; what is added here is one registry entry, which is
the difference between extending a COSE library and hand-rolling COSE.
