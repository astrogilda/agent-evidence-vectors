"""Differential conformance harness for the Adversarial Execution Evidence
(AEE) predicate, v0.6.

Predicate type URI:
    https://in-toto.io/attestation/adversarial-execution-evidence/v0.6

This harness loads every conformance vector under ``vectors/`` (a sibling of
this script's parent directory by default) and checks each one against the
suite MANIFEST expectations:

* accept vectors (``accept/ok-*.json``) must be VALID, recompute to the
  expected ``result``, and derive the expected per-row evidence tiers under
  both key policies (with the pinned TEST substrate key, and with no key);
* reject vectors (``reject/bad-*.json``) must be INVALID with a failure code
  drawn from the MANIFEST's ``expected.codes`` set.

Rails
-----
1. EXTERNAL RAIL (optional): pass ``--verifier <path>`` (or set the
   ``AEE_EXTERNAL_VERIFIER`` environment variable) to run every vector
   through an external verifier.  The harness first probes the verifier
   for v0.6 capability by scanning its bytes for the v0.6 predicate type
   URI; a verifier that does not know the v0.6 type is reported and the
   harness falls back to the reference rail, so the suite is verifiable
   standalone.

   External-implementation contract: a third-party verifier is invoked as
   ``<cmd> <vector-file>``; exit 0 means valid, non-zero
   means invalid; if the LAST stdout line is a JSON object of the shape
   ``{"verdict": "valid"|"invalid", "codes": [...], "result": "...",
   "tiers": [...]}`` the harness additionally checks codes/result/tiers,
   otherwise it checks the verdict only.

2. REFERENCE RAIL (default, self-contained, stdlib-only): an independent
   Python implementation of the spec's checks -- statement well-formedness
   (GATE 0), the byte-checkable per-substrate-row coverage validity gate
   (GATE 1), the pure ``result`` recompute, and the per-row evidence tier
   (GATE 2) -- including RFC 8785 (JCS) canonicalization, RFC 7493
   (I-JSON) payload strictness, DSSE PAEv1, the RFC 6962 domain-separated
   batch root, the versioned run-binding derivation, and pure-Python
   Ed25519 (RFC 8032) for tier signature verification.

The reference rail deliberately emits the SET of every failure it detects;
conformance for a reject vector is ``expected.codes`` intersecting the
emitted set plus verdict equality, so a strict single-code rail and this
superset-emitting rail can both pass the same MANIFEST.

Second-fault-absence self-checks: for every reject vector the harness
additionally asserts that commitments NOT named by the vector's expected
codes still verify (batch root recomputes, vocabulary digest verifies,
corpus digest verifies, record bindings equal the derived binding), which
machine-checks the suite's single-fault discipline.

Outputs a gate-by-vector coverage report: a human table on stdout plus
``conformance-report.json`` (all paths repo-relative).  Exit status: 0 all
checks pass, 1 any check fails, 2 usage or suite-not-found.

TEST KEYS ONLY: the harness re-derives the suite's Ed25519 test keys from
the published recipe ``seed(role) = SHA-256("in-toto-aee-test-key/<role>/v1")``.
These keys prove nothing and must never sign real evidence.

Run ``run_vectors.py --self-test`` to exercise the reference rail against
built-in synthetic statements without needing the vector files.

    decoded-value checks cannot see, anywhere in the statement JSON at any
    depth, not only inside record payloads. Mirrors the Go rail's
    ParseStatement promotion (aee/types.go).

    Two faults are unrecoverable one layer later, because every downstream
    check reads decoded Python strings:

      - a duplicate member, which json.loads keeps the last of, silently;
      - a string whose bytes are not Unicode scalar values, which json.loads
        turns into a lone surrogate or which the UTF-8 decode below rejects.

    The second is what makes GATE 0's observationVocabulary rules sound. They
    compare decoded strings and recompute the digest from them, so they cannot
    tell an unpaired "\\ud800" escape from a legitimate BMP scalar; without
    this gate that escape reached the BMP-only check and passed, and two
    distinct escapes arrived as one string and were reported as a duplicate the
    producer never wrote. Two of those checks cannot even run on a lone
    surrogate -- the UTF-16 sort key and the canonical re-serialization both
    raise UnicodeEncodeError -- so the fault surfaced as a traceback rather
    than a verdict.

    A bounds failure is promoted with them: an incomplete strict pass rules
    nothing out, so padding a statement past the parse bounds, or nesting one
    member deeper than the cap, must not skip the two checks above.

    Faults the payload parser already owns are NOT promoted here: the
    safe-integer profile is scoped to canonicalized content, and a statement
    that is not parseable JSON at all is reported by the caller's own parse.
